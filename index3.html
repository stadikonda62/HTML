        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the layout of content on a webpage using elements called tags, which are used to display text, images, links, tables, forms, and other multimedia content. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language that tells the web browser how to display information. It works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity. Every website on the internet uses HTML as its basic foundation to present content in a structured and readable format.

        A webpage is a single document on the internet that is displayed in a web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. It is usually written using HTML and may include text, images, videos, links, and other multimedia content. A webpage is identified by a unique URL and is part of a larger collection of pages called a website. Webpages can be static, showing fixed content, or dynamic, displaying updated information based on user interaction or data from a server.
