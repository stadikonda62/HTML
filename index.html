    <h1>Importance of Eduaction</h1>
    <p>There is a critical need worldwide for education to prepare students <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to lead successful, fulfilling lives. In today’s world, this means providing young people with educational experiences that nurture their passions, curiosity, and creativity, that develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and that enable lifelong learning. The best solutions involve teachers, parents, students, schools, and communities, take advantage of available resources, are based on evidence, and draw inspiration from successful models.

public education has gone hand in hand with growth </b>band prosperity. Since the mid-19th century, free public education has provided a foundation for millions of people to create a life for themselves and their families, and to become informed, engaged citizens. Today, in the developed world, we take for granted that children start school around the age of five and go through about 11 years of compulsory schooling.
While a primary <i><u>goal of education is to prepare students to become successful adults,</u></i> what it takes to be successful x<sup>2</sup>
a<sup>n</sup>is changing at an ever-increasing pace. The 21st-century world has seen changes that no one would have envisaged even 20 years ago, and classrooms and curricula have not kept up. In the United States disparities in school funding across states and districts, coupled with poverty and racism, have created distressing inequities.
Now is the time for all of us—leaders, educators, parents, students, and society—to think deeply about education and how we can achieve the critical but elusive goal of preparing young people to be successful, engaged, responsible and fulfilled adults.

        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the layout of content on a webpage using elements called tags, which are used to display text, images, links, tables, forms, and other multimedia content. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language that tells the web browser how to display information. It works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity. Every website on the internet uses HTML as its basic foundation to present content in a structured and readable format.
